Welcome to [xpanvictor's](https://www.xpan9.tech) blog site.

## Who is xpan
My name is Oladunjoye Victor, called xpan. I'm a full stack web developer using the 
technologies of ***MERN*** stack. Hence, I'm a __JS__ enthusiast. 
I typically use typescript to enforce type safety in my projects.
I'm a student of computer engineering in the prestigious university of 
**Obafemi Awolowo University**.

## Interests
I basically enjoy anything that deserves my curiosity. Fields that I've restricted
my research are those of STEM.
- __(S)cience__: The beauty of nature yet it's simplicity can always be questioned.
I've dealt with these questions, and it's been fun all through. 
- __(T)echnology__: The application of science is a field that always moves me to
understanding what things are and how to make them provide a solution to common problems.
With this, programming and other applications has been a big interest which I've been
exploring for a while now.
- __(E)ngineering__: This is a field I've not been able to explore well, but I'm
hoping to research soon.
- __(M)athematics__: This is the language of the universe from me. I really love
mathematics as it brings out the thinking and show's how things connect. The originality
of our reasoning can always be questioned from a mathematical standpoint. How do the lines connect?
>> Reasoning is complete only when we can relate our findings with mathematical
>> statements: Leonardo Da Vinci's book of experiments.
 
## What am I doing now?
*Technology:* This is the field I'm currently putting my time. What I've been working on:
- Arduino: Learning hardware using articles online and some youtube guides.
- Learning rust: I enjoy the technology of rust and will become a rustacean soon.
- WebRTC: How we can share our streams and data from a computer directly to another with
little or no server is a technology I find fascinating.
- Operating Systems: Of course, computers are special beings but at the core, one 
realizes how simple a computer can be. With this, I'm taking my time to understand fully
and build my own operating system. Also taking the Nand2Tetris course.
This is a preliminary step for me as the final goal is
to contribute to **Linux**.
