excerpt: "A philosphic view to the reality. From consciousness to physics"
---

A ray of light, a peeble in the ocean, the drop of water, the oxygen in air, the electrons in the atom, the ?. From all
these realizations of the physical world up to the theoretical understanding, is there anything we can actually hold distinct.

Quoting the popular statement, "I think therefore I am", our only realization of reality is based on our own self. Our state of consciousness is the only think we can claim is real and that itself might be enough. However, isn't that expression a bit grandiloquent. Can I really question my own state of consciousness. Is my opinion of myself even true. ]

A question that drives through the heart of my mind is, does my own acceptance of consciousness make other things I see true. This questions the reflection of "I perceive, therefore it is". Can we call this an extension of Ren√© Descartes' statement. Can an extension of "Cogito, ergo sum" ever be realized. 

Another point of view is that of observation. We note the physical world with those parts we've deemed as senses. When I touch a liquid, I can feel it go round my finger. When a note is played, I can hear it pass through me. Well, that's if the note is truly played or I make it play. When I see an object, I can tell an object exists here. That obviously can be just an imagination. With this, do I actually own everything? Do I determine the content of reality. However, Rene helps here again. If I think and that depicts my reality, by induction, we all are. Hold, there's the gap of individuality. How do I think that he thinks? Well, since there's the fluid of realization. We can all share consciousness. With this, we can detect we exist in this circle of reality. 

However, a question of observation again. Light, whether a particle or wave, can be observed by man. However, if that photon travel through space and isn't observed, it continues. However, we don't know this. We just know that once we observe it, it is there. With this, we note that observation brings both the realization of destruction of light.  With this, a lot can be questioned. Is there even any photon around us? Do we create these photons. Is reality a picture of our imagination? Do we determine what exists or not?

Of course, the last paragraph still has a few questions. I still pick one thing though. If light isn't observed, the energy keeps flowing through space although it's not known. We can only agree it's been there cause once we observe it, we know it's been there. This however, brings some piece of quantum realization. Until we observe electrons, we can agree they're both particle and wave. At observation however, we break that piece of uncertainty. At this point, we determine their properties. Instead, the other state we don't include is that they also do not exist. This is however, a more philosophical point of view. With science, we accept an outcome or effect definitely has a cause. 

With this, I conclude these questions. This is however, just a question. Whether I wrote it or not, isn't known. You could've just drafted this with your own consciousness. However, why does your reality do things you don't know about? Do you still feel you think? If something else is in charge, are you the one thinking.

Happy birthday to me, if I exist.
