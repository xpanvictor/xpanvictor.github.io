This must be the clause I've been waiting for a long time. I've been confused and all over the place. Thanks to the system I put in place, whenever I'm confused and not stable on anything, I switch to a minimum effort mode to ensure I don't fall over completely and at least can have a safe landing when I'm back. I've been surviving on minimum effort for a few years say 3 now.
