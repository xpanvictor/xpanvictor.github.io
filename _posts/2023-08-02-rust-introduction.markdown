a while ago but was busy with some other things, this is documenting a summary as I review"

I read the rust book a while ago but couldn't progress building amazing concepts with it due to work
and school. I still love and admire the style and approach the language brings with it.  
This is a series documenting my journey going over the rust book and some projects I did.
Below is the content list
1. [Introduction](#introduction){: .active}


# Introduction
Rust is a systems programming language with key features and interestingly new concepts. It boasts
new methods that achieve great feats unlike the tools we have before.
While learning, I have an habit of documenting key points and snippets per chapter. The repository to which I'll
refer individual chapters to is [here](https://github.com/xpanvictor/rusty).
```rs
println!("Hello world")
```
